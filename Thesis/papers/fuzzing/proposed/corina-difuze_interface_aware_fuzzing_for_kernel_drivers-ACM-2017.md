# DIFUZE 

An interface aware fuzzer. Generates valid input for kernel drivers automatically. `DIFUZE is the first completely automated system that can be generalized to fuzz all Linux kernel drivers on a device running an unmodified kernel.`

**Contributions:**
- *Interface-aware fuzzing:* Provide a new way of fuzzing interface-sensitive targets 
- *Automated driver analysis:* Framework automatically analyzes the kernel source, identifying ioctl entry points, corresponding structures and device file names
- *DIFUZE Prototype:* [Corina Difuze UCSB](www.github.com/ucsb-seclab/difuze)
