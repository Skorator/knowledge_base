## Summary:  
Instead of extending fuzzers in pursuit of high/full code coverage, grey box fuzzing aims to focus on specific targets e.g. the bug prone zone.  By inspecting 42 fuzzers that are not only state-of-the-art but also related to DGF (directed grey box fuzzing) this paper presents the first  study summarising the empirical evidence of research progress. Hereby, not only location bur also behaviour-directed approaches are taken into account. 

### Introduction
Originally directed fuzzers based on symbolic execution. Most fuzzers are coverage based (cover as many program paths as possible. Since bugs are not equally distributed in code, this is neither effective, nor feasible for large code bases.
