# Types of coverage: 
- **Code coverage**: White-box technique, measures to which extent code has been executed.  
- **Test coverage**: Black-box technique, measures how many tests have been executed.

# General Vocabulary: 

- Basic Block: 
	- A straight-line code segment without branches except for the entry and outward branch. Has exactly one entry point and out exit point
	- Usually created by compilers in the first step of compiling programs. The compiler marks *block boundaries*, which are instructions that can begin or end a block by transferring or accepting control. Listings are then cut at these positions, which yields basic blocks.
